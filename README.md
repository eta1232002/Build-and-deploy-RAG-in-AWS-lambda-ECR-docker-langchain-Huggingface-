# Document Question and Answering RAG APPLICATION

🚀 Welcome to the Document Question and Answering (Q&A) RAG Application! This project leverages cutting-edge technologies to create an efficient Q&A system. From model inference to deployment, I've got you covered.

## Overview

ℹ️ This project aims to streamline the process of extracting information from documents by answering user questions using the Retrieve and Generate (RAG) approach. It harnesses the power of AWS Bedrock, AWS AppRunner, AWS ECR, Langchain, FAISS, Docker, GitHub Actions, LangSmith, and Streamlit.

## Features

✨ **Continuous Integration and Deployment**: I've implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure seamless updates and deployments.

⚙️ **AWS Integration**: Leveraging AWS services like Bedrock, AppRunner, and ECR, I've created a scalable and reliable infrastructure for hosting our application.

🔑 **Environment Variables**: I've securely managed our project's deployment environment variables using GitHub Actions, ensuring a smooth deployment process.

## Technologies Used

🛠️ **AWS Bedrock**: Providing a solid foundation for our AWS infrastructure.

📦 **AWS AppRunner**: Simplifying container-based application deployment and management.

🐳 **Docker**: Containerizing our application for easy deployment and scalability.

🤖 **Langchain**: Harnessing the power of language models for advanced natural language processing tasks.

🔍 **FAISS**: Employing efficient similarity search for document retrieval.

🛡️ **GitHub Actions**: Automating our CI/CD pipeline for efficient development workflows.

🔗 **LangSmith**: Integrating powerful language models for inference.

🌐 **Streamlit**: Creating interactive and user-friendly web applications with ease.

## Model Inference and Embeddings

🧠 **Model Inference**: I utilize meta.llama2-13b-chat-v1 for model inference, ensuring accurate responses to user queries.

🔠 **Vector Embeddings**: Leveraging amazon.titan-embed-text-v1 for generating vector embeddings, enabling efficient document representation.
